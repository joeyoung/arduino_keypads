Jan 18/25 Keypad_MCS17 library update notes  G. D. (Joe) Young <jyoung@islandnet.com>

The library update now allows for additional SPI port expander IC--MCP23S18, MCP23S08,
and MCP23S09--in addition to compatible support for MCP23S17 first posted. The MCP23S18
is a two-byte (16-bit) expander, the other two are one-byte.

The revised library constructor includes an optional literal parameter that defaults to
the two-byte port, so no change to sketch that uses a MCP23S17 (or 18). The literals are
defined in the library header are the names of the device (eg MCP23S08) and resolve to
be either 2 (default) or 1.

Some precautions are needed if these devices are to be used together in the same
system:
 - The MCP23S18 is not pin-compatible with the MCP23S17, but both have hardware
   addressing so can share the same SPI bus and chip-select as long as they are given
   different hardware addresses.
 - The MCP23S08 also has hardware addressing so can share the SPI and CS when assigned
   different hardware addresses. The library constructor has an additional parameter
   that accepts the name of the device as a literal.
 - The MCP23S09 is not pin-compatible with the MCP23S08 and does not have hardware
   addressing so cannot share the SPI unless it is selected with a unique chip select.
